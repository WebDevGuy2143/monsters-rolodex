# monsters-rolodex
I coded this application using React from an online course by the name of "Complete React Developer Zero to Mastery" with the instructors Andrei Neagoie, and Yihua Zhang. 

This application basically allows you to dynamically see monsters and their information contained in "cards" as you type letters in the search bar below the title "Monsters Rolodex", and above the card list. 

This application also used an external json api called users.
